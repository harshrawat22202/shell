# shell
Implemented a simple shell which can execute simple commands(including commands joined via pipes) and can run executables
Previous command can be seen by typing "history" (however then that command will not be showed after shell is terminated)
after shell is terminated it displays commands executed on it.
Signals were not implemented in it
